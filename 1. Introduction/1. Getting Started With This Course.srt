1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,270
it is tim buchalka here again I'd like

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,130
to thank you for your investment in this

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,710
course i'm going to do absolutely

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,660
everything in my power to help you get

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,490
up to speed to become a great java

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,740
programming programmers I should say as

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,560
quickly as possible before you get started

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,410
the code theirs a few very important things

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,660
that just wanna go through with you look

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,960
they'll only take a few minutes so

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,910
please bear with me

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,210
this will help you really

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,640
maximize your experience getting the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,010
most out of this course

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,560
firstly high-definition content and this

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,290
video player does allow you to play

17
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,590
videos in different resolutions so what

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,770
you want to do is make sure you've

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,290
chosen the highest available resolution

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,290
via the gear icon which you can see

21
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,560
in the bottom right-hand corner of the

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,650
screen and essentially the higher the

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,080
number the better the quality now we'll

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,000
play up to 1080p videos so 1080p is the

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,070
quality of video that I've uploaded for

26
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,810
every video in this course the dates and if the

27
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,180
video to look low quality to you you

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,910
want to check while the video is playing and

29
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,720
make sure that you click on the gear icon

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,580
and make sure you have selected the

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,220
highest quality and do note that

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,250
depending on your internet speed the 1080p

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,290
option may not be available to 1080p

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,570
if you want to changed the speed of a video

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,620
in other words how fast it plays you can do

36
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,870
that by hovering over the 1x icon

37
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,200
as you can see on the screen they're

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,740
choosing a speed you want here is a close

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,730
up of that

40
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,150
now all videos have got close

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,730
captions on them to enable closed captions just

42
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,710
hover your mouse over the captions icon that

43
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,360
you can see pointing to the screen

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,330
there and click on English us that turns

45
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,430
the captions on

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,890
and once you've selected closed captions

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,230
on a single video all other videos in

48
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,210
the course will play with captions on

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,330
until you turn off that option so one of

50
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,760
the things you may need to do from time

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,870
to time is search for specific lecture

52
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,600
I do recommend that you start this

53
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
course in order and go to each

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,410
video in order but it can be a good

55
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,460
idea sometimes to do a search and

56
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,330
you can see that the main course

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,940
dashboard the course content tab has

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,060
got a lecture search box and in that box

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,370
you can actually type in a keyword or

60
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,350
different words you're looking for and

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,880
udemy will display a list of all the

62
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
lectures in these course that have those

63
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,990
words in the title for example you could

64
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,680
do a search for jdk and all the videos

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,230
in this course with lecture with that word

66
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,180
in the title will appear for you just an easy way to

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,380
find a particular lectures

68
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,330
now another very important thing for

69
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,960
programmers is to be able to search for

70
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,370
questions and answers you can do that by

71
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,020
going to the Q&A tab in udemy and once

72
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,100
you click on that you'll see that

73
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,940
there's a search box

74
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,680
and from there you can type in a

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,050
question or some keywords and

76
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,080
udemy will automatically find previous

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,940
questions and answers have been ask

78
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,080
that a similar to what you're searching for

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,790
so can be a good way just to find some

80
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,400
information immediately and then you

81
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,630
just click on the thread to read the

82
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,970
questions and all the answers that were

83
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,930
made for that particular post

84
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,070
if you can't find answers to your question

85
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,230
bearing in mind there are thousands

86
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,880
of questions and answers in the course so

87
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,070
it is definitely worth while you researching

88
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,530
first but if you can't find an answer you

89
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,600
can create a new question by clicking on

90
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,060
the ask a new question button just note

91
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,650
there that sometimes you may have to type

92
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,750
something in the box to the left before

93
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,020
the button becomes active enabled to

94
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,670
enable you to actually click it

95
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,630
so after pressing that button you'll be

96
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,940
taken to the question editor where you can

97
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,100
edit your question and post information

98
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,040
the question that your looking to get answered

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,020
a quick note a screenshot is

100
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,350
often recommended now rather than just

101
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,940
sort of saying that you got an error it

102
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,070
can often be really helpful to create a

103
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,320
screenshot of the problem on your screen and

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,060
using the mechanism that I got on the screen

105
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,370
here to upload that screenshot directly

106
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,090
to udemy

107
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,880
it's going to prompt you to drag and

108
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,660
drop an image or click it on the or

109
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,030
click on the choose file button once you

110
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,440
do that you can add the image to your

111
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,010
questions and the images will appear in

112
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,360
the Box similar to like you can see

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,860
there so you put the cursor where you

114
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,800
want the image to appear and i'll put

115
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,730
in it for you automatically

116
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,650
another really cool thing you can do is

117
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,320
you can also directly paste source code

118
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,510
into your question by just copying the

119
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,000
source code from your editor and pasting it

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,310
right in the box once you do that it

121
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,990
will show the source box in a box similar

122
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,450
to what you can see on the screen until your

123
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,270
questions actually save or posted and

124
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,730
once you do that you'll actually see

125
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,950
here that actually formats the code

126
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,680
and also nicely color codes as well so

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
this could be a really good way to

128
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,550
show the code that you're working on

129
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,130
and perhaps any errors so that myself or

130
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,520
other students can help you with

131
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,030
once you completed entering your question just

132
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,110
click on the post question button and

133
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,730
your questions are then posted to the course

134
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,860
and i actually get notified but also

135
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,440
other students will be able to see that and

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
chime in and answer it

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,010
one other thing I recommend you

138
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,510
do is when your question has been

139
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,270
solved by either myself or another student or

140
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,680
even yourself for that matter

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
it's a great idea to mark it as solved so

142
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,870
put two left square bracket and the word

143
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,720
solved into the title so this shows up in

144
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,910
the future searches and help other

145
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,320
students looking for help on that topic

146
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,970
because you know if you can see the

147
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,590
word solved you know that has

148
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,690
been a resolution to that problem and

149
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,080
directs people to that specific answer so

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,610
to do its quite simple you can edit

151
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,860
your question title and contents by

152
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,360
clicking on the question and then

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,100
clicking those three vertical dots you

154
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,830
can see to the top right of the image and

155
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,900
clicking on edit after clicking on edit

156
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,120
you now are able to edit the title and

157
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,590
content for that matter of your question

158
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,050
so you can now add the solved term on the

159
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,760
question title to mark it as solved and

160
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
once you've done that click on the save'

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,930
button once you done that that the question is

162
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,520
then updated you can see the title is

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,920
updated with the word solved in

164
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,620
square brackets

165
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,530
now something that you may want is the

166
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,230
source code so every single lecture in

167
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,150
this course has got its own source code

168
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,670
and also other resources such as links

169
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,650
etc that have been discussed in that

170
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,840
lecture now you will know that a lecture has

171
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,580
got resources because when you're

172
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,350
playing it and you move your mouse you

173
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,760
can see in the top left of the video

174
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,000
a little blue box

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,520
click on that box that opens up the

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,800
resources and from their you can click on to

177
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,630
download the source code or get access

178
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,580
to the various links if there are any

179
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,700
for that specific lecture

180
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,590
alternatively you can actually go down

181
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,200
to the bottom of the course in the source

182
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,090
code for all programs lecture which is in

183
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,240
the extra section and from there you can

184
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,740
also download the source code if you

185
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,730
want

186
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,490
and finally you find course news in the

187
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,900
announcement tab can be a good idea

188
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,530
to a click on that and check that

189
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,980
section out it will just keep you updated

190
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,080
on what's happening with this course you

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,700
should also get an email from me every

192
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,230
time that I do post an announcement

193
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,610
that's just another way for you to get

194
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,710
access to it

195
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,550
alright so that's all I wanted to say

196
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,110
about that let's now get cracking into

197
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,180
downloading and installing the necessary

198
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,550
tools so that we can start our java

199
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,830
programming see you in the next video
