00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,290
Welcome to Section 3.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,630
Tim Buchalka here again,

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,020
and in this section were going to go

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,540
ahead and create our very first program.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,850
That's right our very first Java program

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,870
'Hello World' program.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,120
So you're going to get an overview

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,560
and an understanding of

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,220
about what it takes to create

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,310
a Java program.

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,200
And then we're going to go

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,820
through there and take a look at 'IntelliJ',

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,200
give it a... Go thorough an overview of it if you will

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,210
just to make sure that you understand

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,650
some of the basics about it.

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,100
Which will equip you very well

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,970
for the section after that. But, for now

18
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,300
let's make a start on our 'Hello World' program.
