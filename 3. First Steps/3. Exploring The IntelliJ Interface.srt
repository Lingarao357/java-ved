1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,510
In the previous video, we had our first

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,160
real experience with 'IntelliJ IDEA'.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,750
We managed to create our very first 'Hello

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,070
World' application, and even modified the

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,070
program to print our name.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,700
It's now time to explore 'IntelliJ IDEA' a little bit more.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,290
Just to understand the various windows, and start

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,380
to understand how things are put together.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,970
And just to have a look, and see where 'IntelliJ IDEA'

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,900
stores our files as we creating our programs.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,090
First things first. If you look in the top of the screen

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,750
you can see the location

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,630
where 'IntelliJ IDEA' has

14
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,940
placed our programs. And if you remember,

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,730
in the previous video, we defined the location

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,460
where that was going to be.

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,870
So I'm going to go into that folder,

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,600
just have a look, and see what files are in there.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,770
So, I'm going to open up my 'Finder'.

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,520
And you would open up, if you are on a 'Windows'

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,220
machine, you'd open up 'Windows Explorer'.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,000
And you can see I'm in my 'Desktop'.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,440
My path is 'Desktop'->'JavaPrograms'

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,550
you can see at the top there.

25
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,880
So I'm in the right folder. I'm going to

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
go into the 'HelloWorld' folder.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,500
And you can see that there's a number of files

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,940
there that have now been added by 'IntelliJ IDEA'.

29
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,570
Firstly, there's a 'HelloWorld.iml'.

30
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,970
Now that is a file that's created by 'IntelliJ IDEA'

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,710
And that's used to keep track of the state

32
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,800
of this project. So it's not something you would

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,870
ever need to edit or open, or use in any way.

34
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,170
But you certainly wouldn't want to delete it either.

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,940
But the interesting one is in the 'src' folder.

36
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,460
'src' is an abbreviation for 'source'.

37
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,100
There's a file, and you can see it's called 'Hello.java'.

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,570
So, and that equates exactly as you can see,

39
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,090
just above the 'Finder' window there, 'Hello.java'.

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,680
So when you create a new 'class'

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,960
in 'IntelliJ', it creates a file, and it ends in '.java'.

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,430
So all java files that you're creating end in '.java'.

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,430
Now if you have a look in the 'out' folder,

44
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,400
expand that

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,630
you can see there's a 'Hello.class' file.

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,580
And looking at the sizes, you notice that

47
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,980
'Hello.class' is larger than the 'Hello.java'.

48
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,340
Now the 'Hello.class' is the compiled version

49
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,910
of the 'class'.

50
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,260
Whereas the 'Hello.java' contains the code,

51
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,260
as you can see on the screen there.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:31,720
The 'Hello.class', if I go to open that, contains what

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,280
looks a little bit like mumbo-jumbo.

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
It certainly hasn't got the same code, that we

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,620
typed into the 'IntelliJ IDEA' in previous video.

56
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,780
A '.class' file is the compiled version of the

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,060
program, and that would be the one that

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,370
you would use to distribute and send your

59
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,930
code out to other people.

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,700
But we'll be talking a lot more about 'class' files

61
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,420
in the future videos. For now all you really need

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,860
to know is that you create programs in 'IntelliJ'

63
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,890
that are saved off in a file format that ends in '.java'.

64
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,880
And 'IntelliJ' will automatically when you 'run' the

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,030
program, create these '.class' files.

66
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,440
So just keep in mind that you probably don't want

67
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,340
to delete anything in these files for now.

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,310
You do all your changes to your java code

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,800
normally would be done in the editor itself

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,070
within in 'IntelliJ IDEA' and not anywhere else.

71
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,210
So going back to 'IntelliJ' now.

72
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,990
So over here to the left is the 'Project View',

73
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,110
the 'Project Window', and you can see that

74
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,530
the project is showing on the screen there.

75
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,800
If by chance yours isn't showing projects,

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,920
you can click on this 'dropdown box'

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,680
and select 'Project' from that.

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,560
And if you recall, that mirrors pretty well exactly

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,000
what we saw a minute ago in the 'Finder Window'.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,700
So 'IntelliJ' in the  standard 'project

81
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,530
view' is really mirroring the contents

82
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,000
in the 'IntelliJ IDEA' product with what's on file.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And that's all handled for you automatically.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,180
The other thing I want to point out, is that

85
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,810
you don't need to worry about 'saving' files.

86
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,350
In some programming languages,

87
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,090
you may need to actually manually save your files.

88
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,340
'IntelliJ' product is automatically saving things for you.

89
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,990
It's rare that you'll ever need too.

90
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,690
If you want to try and do that

91
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,620
for some reason, you click up here into 'File'

92
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,100
and click on 'Save All', but generally speaking

93
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,270
'IntelliJ' is handling the saving of this

94
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,090
behind the scenes, and writing those files out

95
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,810
and writing any changes you make

96
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,420
to those files as I showed you in the 'Finder Window'.

97
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,690
Now one of the other things you can do,

98
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,390
you can change the location of some of these windows.

99
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,630
For example, you might decide that down here, this

100
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,630
little 'Run' window, you may want that on

101
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,860
the right hand side instead of down at the bottom.

102
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,740
So what you could do, you could come over here

103
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,030
and click on this little 'cog'.

104
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,580
And when you click on 'Move to->'Right'

105
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,240
And you can see now, we've now got that

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,180
file on the right hand side, and of course that frees up

107
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,570
more room down here that was being taken up in the

108
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,210
past when that 'Run' window was at

109
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,480
the bottom of the screen.

110
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,610
You can also make windows bigger.

111
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,320
or smaller to your taste. Whatever you need.

112
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,090
And you can open and close a particular

113
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,930
window by clicking the 'View' menu

114
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,840
Going to 'Tool Windows'. In this case

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
the 'Project', if I select that again

116
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,870
that actually 'removes' the window from the screen.

117
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,060
And if I want that window to come back again,

118
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,810
click on 'View'->'Tool Windows' and 'Project'.

119
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,450
And you can see I've got a shortcut

120
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,860
to the right hand side there.

121
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,340
On a 'Mac' its 'Cmd+1'.

122
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,470
But that will be different,

123
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,190
depending if you're running 'Windows' or 'Linux'.

124
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,520
Just go to the relevant option, 'View'->'Tool Windows'

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,950
and you'll see what the shortcut is.

126
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,260
You'll end up getting to know these

127
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,360
quite well as you use 'IntelliJ',

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,820
and start expanding your knowledge of Java.

129
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,940
I'll now open up the 'Project' window again.

130
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,290
And you'll see that's now open.

131
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,400
Another thing you can do is you can set

132
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
the windows to 'floating' mode.

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,410
And to do that, click on the 'cog' for the relevant window

134
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,410
go down and click 'Floating Mode'.

135
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,220
Once you do that, you've got a free-standing window,

136
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
that you can move anywhere on the screen.

137
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,350
And it's not actually fixed or docked

138
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,300
in with the rest of the windows that are

139
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,850
part of 'IntelliJ IDEA'.

140
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,460
That could be good for example, if you

141
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
had multiple monitors and you might want to put

142
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,420
part of your, some of your windows

143
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,420
on the one monitor, and the rest on another.

144
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,650
And to go back, click back and again just click on

145
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,830
'Floating Mode' again, and that will actually

146
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,970
put it back where it was.

147
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,300
And if you want to, you can come over

148
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,720
here to 'Window' menu, and you could

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,430
save the current layout, if you had

150
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,980
a particular way you wanted to save the

151
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,460
windows to always go back to that particular state.

152
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,770
You can click on 'Store Current Layout as Default',

153
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,830
and then, if I go ahead and make some changes,

154
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,350
for example, if I move that back to the bottom again

155
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,360
and let's say I closed the 'Project' window,

156
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,020
I can come back here to 'Window'->

157
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,020
'Restore Default Layout',

158
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,040
and it actually goes back to whatever the

159
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
state was when you actually saved it.

160
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,340
So that can be quite handy just

161
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,940
to size up the windows

162
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,570
and to choose a format

163
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,460
that makes sense for you and works

164
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,970
with your particular setup.

165
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,430
So you now know the basics of how to

166
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,500
manipulate 'IntelliJ IDEA' and to create a

167
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,890
custom layout that suits your machine.

168
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,500
In the next Section, I'm going to start

169
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,220
talking more about Java,

170
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,250
and we're going to start learning the actual

171
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,950
commands and what they mean.

172
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,920
And specifically, we're going to start on

173
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,100
data types and variables,

174
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
and build our understanding from there.

175
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,330
So I'll see you in that next Section.
