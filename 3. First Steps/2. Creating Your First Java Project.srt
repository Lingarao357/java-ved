1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,990
In this video, we're going to make our very first

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,690
Java Application.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,460
We're going to make an application call 'Hello World'.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,880
Now in computing terms, it's been

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,670
a tradition, that the very first

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,900
program you create in a new language,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,010
to get the computer to print out a message

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,760
that simply says 'Hello World'.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,530
Nothing more, nothing less.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,040
So the idea is just to show you some ...

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,050
basics of that language.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,450
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to click

13
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,370
on 'Create New Project'.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,540
This brings up a rather intimidating

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,180
looking screen, but it isn't as bad as it looks.

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,050
Now depending on the 'Edition' of 'IntelliJ' that

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,810
you're running. Whether you're running the

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,520
'Ultimate Edition' like I am,

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
or whether you're running the 'Community Edition',

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,720
you will see there's different options

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,610
here to the left hand side.

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,900
Now because I'm running the 'Ultimate Edition',

23
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,740
and this is the paid version of 'IntelliJ';

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,550
the 'Jetbrains' people, the makers of 'IntelliJ'

25
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,550
give you a lot more options.

26
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,210
But you don't need to worry about this

27
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,100
whether you're running the 'Ultimate Edition',

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,360
or running the 'Community Edition',

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,460
just make sure you click on 'java'

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,120
to the top left hand corner, like so.

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,930
Now you should also have a 'Project SDK'

32
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,540
showing there, and it should say something like '1.8'.

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,720
May be the future, may be a different number

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,600
but that's okay, it'll still work.

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,260
Now if you haven't got one.

36
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,550
Refer back to the 'SDK'

37
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,350
the Java Development Kit installation video,

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,430
and I actually went through and showed you how to

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,120
install a Java Development Kit.

40
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,990
And if you're sure you've done that

41
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,420
and this is not showing,

42
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,510
go back and check out the 'IntelliJ'

43
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,760
installation video.

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Because right at the end of that video,

45
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,540
I go through and show you how to finish off

46
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,710
the setup of the 'Project SDK', and that involves

47
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,510
telling 'IntelliJ' where to find the new

48
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,310
Java Development Kit.

49
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,210
Again, make sure java is selected

50
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,920
leave everything else there unselected

51
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,560
there, we don't need to click on anything.

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,070
Click on 'Next'.

53
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,160
And you'll see this option

54
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,250
'Create project from template',

55
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,090
I'm going to leave that unchecked

56
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,090
because we want to create a brand new project

57
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,090
from scratch.

58
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm going to click on 'Next'.

59
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,340
Next, it's asking you for the

60
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,490
'Project name' and also the 'Project location'.

61
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,820
'Project name' is self-explanatory. We're going to

62
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,770
call that one 'Hello World'.

63
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,100
Now I've typed it on the screen with spaces.

64
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,860
But I don't actually recommend you type 'spaces'.

65
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,360
For a project name, you want to type in whatever it is,

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
and you can use upper and lowercase freely.

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,930
But don't put any 'spaces' in there, and that's because

68
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,210
often, depending on your operating system,

69
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,850
you can run into difficulties with spaces

70
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,350
in path names.

71
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,830
So I suggest you leave that like so, so I'm

72
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,830
calling this one 'HelloWorld'.

73
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,590
I typed it 'correctly' this time.

74
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,770
And if you click on 'More Settings' down at the bottom,

75
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,850
you get some other options; and it gives you things like

76
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,290
the 'Content root', the 'Project format'

77
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,010
and the 'Module file location'.

78
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,770
We don't need to worry about any of that at this stage.

79
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,710
We can just stick to the basics which was the

80
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,420
'Project name', 'HelloWorld' and the 'Project location'.

81
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,300
I'm going to change this location

82
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,550
to another location though.

83
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,130
And because this is my first java application,

84
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,100
on this computer, you can see

85
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,300
I've got a 'Project location' and that's because of

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,100
I've been creating a java application

87
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
for another one of my courses, I don't want

88
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,580
to put my source code in there.

89
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
What I want to do is I want to click on this

90
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
button over here to the right,

91
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,990
and I want to navigate to a new folder

92
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,420
and I want to create a new folder that's

93
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,420
going to contain all the java code

94
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,510
that we'll be using for this course.

95
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,090
So to make it simple I'm just going to click on 'Desktop'

96
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,810
and I'm going to click on 'New Folder'

97
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:48,590
and I'm going to type in 'JavaPrograms'.

98
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,740
And click on 'Create'.

99
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,820
And that's going to be the folder that I'm going to

100
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,890
store all my java code in.

101
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,300
Going to click on 'Choose', and you can see it's

102
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,330
now updated and it's actually updated

103
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,810
to point to that path

104
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,720
But what it's done at the moment is, it's only

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,320
given me the name of the main folder.

106
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,220
In fact what I want to do is create a

107
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,960
subfolder that contains each project.

108
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,170
So that if I've got two projects

109
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,170
they've each both their own folder

110
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,170
in 'JavaPrograms'.

111
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,290
So what I'm going to do is click on again

112
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,650
to the right here, and I'm going to click on 'New Folder',

113
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,780
and I'm going to type in 'HelloWorld'.

114
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,840
And that's going to be the folder that

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,370
contains our first application.

116
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,160
So you can see now that

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,730
'Project name' is 'HelloWorld'

118
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,160
the 'location' is now 'Users/' in my case

119
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
dev/Desktop/JavaPrograms/HelloWorld

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,820
So it's got it's own folder and the 'Project name' is

121
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,270
going to be 'HelloWorld' that's stored in that folder.

122
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,410
Now you may have, if you're running on Windows

123
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,610
you'll see that this folder location will be a little bit

124
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,170
different. You'll probably have something like

125
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,600
'C:\Users (you know whatever your user name is)\

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
perhaps a link to the 'Documents' folder

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,540
You'll just need to navigate to a folder that

128
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
you'll remember where these files will be,

129
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,120
depending on your operating system.

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,420
But that's where mine are going to be.

131
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
So now I'm going to click on 'Finish'.

132
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
So what's happening now is

133
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,400
the 'IntelliJ' editor is now creating a folder

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,990
in that directory and it's containing the base files

135
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,260
that we'll be using for our application.

136
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,430
Now before we get started, I just want to point out

137
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
the 'Tip of the Day'.

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,200
This is a little box that comes up

139
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,560
every time you first start up 'IntelliJ'.

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,790
And you can turn these 'tips' off, because that's what

141
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,450
they are, their 'tips for the day'.

142
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,600
And I suggest you leave it on,

143
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,210
and actually read some of these. Because it

144
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,670
gives you some really clever shortcuts

145
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,500
and it gives you an overview of some of the

146
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,740
features that included with 'IntelliJ'.

147
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,850
Definitely worth your time to read some of these.

148
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,260
and you can click on 'Next [Tip]'

149
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,570
to go through and read what some of the

150
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,640
other tips are. And again it's just

151
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,330
a great way for finding out some of the

152
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,480
capabilities that the 'IntelliJ IDEA'

153
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,460
product has got.

154
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
to really save you a lot of time

155
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,090
when it comes to development.

156
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,370
I'm going to click on 'Close',

157
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,900
and I'm going to leave the 'Tips' On.

158
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,640
But if for some reason you didn't want

159
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,430
the 'Tips' to show, just click on the checkbox.

160
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,350
So what we're going to do now is click

161
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,500
on this little button down here to the left

162
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,580
which is called on a Mac a disclosure

163
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,910
triangle. But in any event, you'll click

164
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,180
that and it just opens up as you can see.

165
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,870
And I'm going to click here where it says

166
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,750
'src' which is the abbreviation for 'source'.

167
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,880
And what that is, is the location

168
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,240
where we'll be putting our java source code.

169
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,290
So I'm going to right-click that now.

170
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,480
You notice that when I click

171
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,910
that I get what is a huge

172
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,250
menu of options, and

173
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,720
believe if I'm not down the track

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
once you've had a bit of experience with java

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,530
a lot of these will make a lot more sense to you.

176
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,970
Right now I can see tht's

177
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,230
probably overwhelming but you

178
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,850
don't need to memorize anything.

179
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,850
The only thing you need to do is click on 'New'.

180
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,150
and come over here where it says 'Java Class',

181
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,150
and click on 'Java Class'.

182
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,350
This brings up a little window and

183
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,100
'IntelliJ' is now saying, 'What is the name of the

184
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,020
Class that you want to create?'.

185
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,300
Now don't worry if you don't know what a 'Class' is.

186
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,770
In later lectures, we're going to be going through in

187
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,200
detail explaining what 'Classes' are.

188
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,380
For now, it's just good for you to follow along

189
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,650
and do what I'm doing and when we get

190
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,990
to the stage of you needing to know more

191
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,550
about 'class', I'm going to go into that in more detail.

192
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,510
Let's create one and we're just going to call it 'Hello'.

193
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,440
Okay, and I'm going to click on 'OK'.

194
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
Now don't be to concerned about

195
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,180
the contents that are on the screen

196
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,790
we're going to go through that in detail in ...

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,770
... future videos. For now let's just get a basic

198
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,770
program up and working.

199
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,920
in 'IntelliJ' so that we can actually tick the

200
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,110
box that says we've created our

201
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,860
first java application, and we've actually run it.

202
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,060
I'm going to press 'Enter' on the end of the first line,

203
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,020
and I'm going to type

204
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,180
'public static void (I'm putting spaces between them)

205
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,050
Now as your typing do make sure you

206
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,310
type in exactly the same 'case' with exactly the

207
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,720
same spelling as you can see me typing.

208
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,180
It's very common for new programmers or people

209
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,910
using another programming language

210
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,610
to type things in to make typing mistakes

211
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,910
or to type things in a different case.

212
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,790
For example, instead of a lowercase 'p'

213
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,640
for the style of the word 'public', if I typed it

214
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,560
an uppercase 'P', you'll get a completely different result.

215
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
In this case, it's highlighted in 'red'

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,210
which is saying 'there's an error'.

217
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,280
So do make sure you check your code carefully

218
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,240
that you're typing it in exactly as you see

219
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
me type it. And if you ... see anything like

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,260
this in 'red', you can just put your mouse over it

221
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,700
and 'IntelliJ' will normally tell you what the problem is.

222
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,440
In this case it's saying "Cannot resolve symbol 'Public'"

223
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,330
and that's because the first letter was typed

224
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,640
in uppercase 'P'.

225
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
So I'm going to make that lowercase 'p' again.

226
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,190
So let's finish off our first program. So,

227
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,430
'public static void main'

228
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,990
With spaces in between.

229
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,650
then a regular 'bracket' [parenthesis].

230
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,030
The word 'String' with a capital 'S'.

231
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,100
And I'm going to put two ... square [ ] brackets

232
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,820
Notice those brackets a little bit different

233
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
to the other bracket's (parentheses) we've used.

234
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,820
and the word 'args'

235
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,820
I'm going to put a brace ({) now.

236
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,840
The brace ({)  is the same character as

237
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,670
the one you see after the word 'Hello'

238
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,750
Okay, now we've done that. Now we're going to type

239
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,090
'System' with a capital 'S' dot (.)

240
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:06,340
'out.printl' (and as I type the 'l')

241
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,510
you notice that 'IntelliJ' came up and said

242
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,870
'Oh do you mean 'println'?' which is an

243
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,760
abbreviation for 'print line'.

244
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,810
So if you want that and you're happy with that,

245
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,420
you just double-click that if you want

246
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,450
and you'll notice how 'IntelliJ' filled out the rest

247
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,980
of the line for us, which is great.

248
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,150
Now what I'm going to do is go back here

249
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,830
to this little brackets (parentheses) [println()].

250
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,310
And I'm going to type in a double quote (")

251
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,760
And notice how I only typed one double quote ("),

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,660
but 'IntelliJ' added ... the second one automatically.

253
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,210
And that's because 'IntelliJ'

254
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,090
is saying, quite rightly, 'Well if you type one

255
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,880
double quote (") you need to have a second one

256
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,570
to make it valid in java.'

257
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,030
So it quite conveniently added that for you.

258
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,740
So in those double quotes, I'm going to type 'Hello'

259
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,140
', World' and I'm going to put an

260
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,620
exclamation mark (!) after it.

261
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,620
So at this point, we're now

262
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,460
done with our first java application. We've

263
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,880
created a valid java application.

264
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,090
We know that it's valid, because there are no 'red'

265
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,370
errors on the screen.

266
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,070
We can't see any errors showing up, so

267
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,580
the next thing to do is to actually run the

268
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,510
application. So how do we actually get it

269
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,480
to do something? Because this

270
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,290
'System.out.println' or print line

271
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,680
which it's an abbreviation for is meant to

272
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
display 'Hello, World!' the message

273
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
somewhere on the computer.

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,860
Well it turns out, that running it is quite easy,

275
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,670
you just literally need to right click.

276
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,010
That brings up a menu with a lot of options

277
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,860
but the one you want is 'Run 'Hello.main()'.

278
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,210
So I'm going to click on that.

279
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,450
You notice something happened.

280
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,960
Something happened down at the bottom briefly

281
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
and now a little window's appeared.

282
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,120
And you can now see, we've actually got a message

283
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
which says 'Hello, World!'.

284
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,720
And it's got 'Process finished with exit code 0'.

285
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,510
Now we'll be talking more about what that means

286
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,530
in a future video, but the bottom line

287
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,610
is you've now created and successfully run

288
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,980
your first 'HelloWorld' application.

289
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,360
Challenge time! How would you go about modifying

290
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,360
the output to instead of putting 'Hello, World!',

291
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,050
to put 'Hello' and your name?

292
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,050
For example, 'Hello Tim!'

293
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm going to pause the video.

294
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,980
Go ahead and make that change so that

295
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,980
the outcome becomes 'Hello Tim!'

296
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,400
instead of 'Hello, World!', or substitute

297
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,740
the word 'Tim' for 'your name'.

298
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,640
Go for it now!

299
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,710
And we'll come back shortly and

300
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,810
show you how to do it.

301
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,580
Welcome back!

302
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,360
So did you get that going okay?

303
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,780
Well it turns out the change is pretty easy.

304
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,480
All we really need to do is we nee go into here,

305
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,680
and we can go back and just delete it

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,900
as we would using a normal word processor.

307
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,600
Delete those characters out.

308
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
and type in your name like so.

309
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,900
And if you want to put in an exclamation mark (!).

310
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,370
Doing that, we'll actually display the

311
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,600
message 'Hello Tim!'.

312
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,470
But to see that message on the screen

313
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,130
again we need to right click,

314
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,770
and click on 'Run...'.

315
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,540
And you can see down on the bottom of the screen,

316
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,710
we've now got 'Hello Tim!' So that's it!

317
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,460
That's our first very basic java application.

318
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,770
In the next video, I'm going to walk you through

319
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,030
some of the basic functions within

320
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,330

321
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,670
parts of the screen, and how to move some of the

322
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,300
windows around depending on the amount

323
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,920
of screen real estate you've got.

324
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
And just to help you become a little bit more familiar

325
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,250
