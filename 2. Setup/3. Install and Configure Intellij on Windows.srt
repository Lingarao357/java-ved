1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,330
In this video we're going to download

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,019
and install and configure IntelliJ IDEA

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,400
which is the integrated development

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,619
environment or IDE then we're going to

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,750
be using to write our java programs.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,949
In this video is for the Windows platform

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,949
there's also a version for a Mac or for

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,900
a Linux machine so I refer to those

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,700
videos as appropriate, if you're on

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,190
Windows start by going to JetBrains.com

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,619
in a browser

12
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,000
and once that take it still that pages

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,690
kept down here we click on tools I move

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,320
over here look look okay do that and we

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
want this IntelliJ IDEA I will click on

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,930
download on the IntelliJ IDEA image

17
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,420
there and then I'll bring up this page

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,870
and when you go to download IntelliJ

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,210
IDEA you've got two options here you can

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,339
choose the ultimate or the Community

21
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,350
Edition. Now firstly you can see the

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,839
difference is showing here I won't go

23
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:02,220
into those now because most of those

24
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,839
won't make any difference to you at this

25
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,489
point if you're just starting out with

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,100
Java, so the Community Edition over here

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,689
on the right-hand side well that's the

28
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,610
free open-source version so you will

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,740
never need to pay and that's the version

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,299
that time going to install down download

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,070
and install now I'm just going to click

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,890
on that and start the download then

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,090
we'll just talk briefly about the

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,350
Ultimate Edition I'm just going to click

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,900
back to go to that previous page.

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,250
Now the other thing you can do is you can

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,290
download the Ultimate Edition and that's

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,810
got extra tools and capabilities you get

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,640
a free trial however you will need to

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,159
pay for that after the trial finishes so

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,540
for most people you probably want to

42
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,100
download and use the Community Edition

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,070
but what JetBrains have done is that

44
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,630
given me the ability to extend your

45
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,490
trial, so if you want to try out this

46
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,350
Ultimate Edition normally you give a

47
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,659
30-day trial I can give you an extra 90

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,850
days bringing the total trial period to

49
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,700
120 days so if you want to do that

50
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,070
download the Ultimate Edition then look

51
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,540
for the information in this section of

52
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,830
the course where I could show you how to

53
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,170
go about getting a key to extend that to

54
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,780
120 days but that's optional and as I

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,519
said the Community Edition will work

56
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,310
just fine in this course. Alright so I'm

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,140
just going to fast forward now and let

58
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,180
the rest of the IntelliJ download

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,950
complete and then we'll go through the

60
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,160
installation and configuration.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,350
Okay so you can see the download is now

62
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,750
complete, so if I start now the process

63
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,030
the program rather that I've downloaded

64
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,700
that's going to go ahead now and install

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,050
IntelliJ Community Edition onto my

66
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,010
computer I'm gonna close in the browser

67
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,450
now we'll just go through now this

68
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,550
wizard to set it up I'm gonna click on

69
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,490
next click on next to use the default

70
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,910
destination folder now this part this

71
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,140
screen that's popped up is very

72
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,180
important firstly if you're running a

73
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,730
32-bit version of Windows and if you

74
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,660
don't know whether you're running a

75
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,880
32-bit version refer to the JDK

76
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,070
installation video in this section of

77
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,270
the course because I show you how to get

78
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,490
access to that but if you are running a

79
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,250
32-bit version and most people probably

80
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,710
won't be doing that but if you are if

81
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,470
you can 32-bit launcher and then click

82
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,920
on download and install JRE x86 by JetBrains,

83
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,630
very important that you do that because

84
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,670
you'll find that IntelliJ won't work

85
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,430
unless you do that but that's if you're

86
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,950
running a 32-bit version most people

87
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,540
will be running a 64-bit version of

88
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,000
Windows so that's the case select 64-bit

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,160
launcher and that's all you'll need to

90
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,920
do if you are running a 64-bit version

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,710
in both cases whether you're running 32 or 64-bit

92
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,870
I suggest you click on these three

93
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,790
options here Java groovy Kotlin

94
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,630
kt that just gives you the ability to

95
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,000
open files of that type in IntelliJ so

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,660
click on next now you can't install so

97
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,710
obviously that's now going through the

98
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,440
process of installing IntelliJ on this

99
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,600
computer. Now once that installation is

100
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
finished there's a few other things we

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
need to do firstly we need to configure

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,470
the Java development kit so that it it

103
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,030
actually works with in IntelliJ so we

104
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,040
need to associate the jdk

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,780
downloaded previously, so that happens

106
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,760
then we need to configure and tweak a

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,980
few settings within IntelliJ just to

108
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,360
make things a little bit easy for you to

109
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,820
use the Java development and once we've

110
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,380
done that we can then move on and start

111
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,350
working in IntelliJ and creating Java

112
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,510
programs, so I'm going to pause the video

113
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,800
here now and we'll come back where this

114
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,670
installation process has completed.

115
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,620
Okay, so installation is now completed we

116
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,150
don't want to run IntelliJ IDEA

117
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,350
Community Edition so I'm gonna check

118
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,430
their box and click on finish once

119
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,969
you've started IntelliJ you get this

120
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,709
option you can either click on the

121
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:42,289
option custom location to install it to

122
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,879
import rather some settings from a

123
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,709
previous installation of IntelliJ IDEA

124
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,629
or you can click on do not import

125
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,029
settings, in most cases do not import

126
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,799
settings would be the right option and

127
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,149
you can see that's the default I'm just

128
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,829
going to click on ok because I don't

129
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,360
want to import any settings from a

130
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,439
previous installation

131
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,719
I think this option about data sharing

132
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:01,729
I'm going to click on don't send because

133
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,439
I don't want to send any data to JetBrains

134
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,599
but you can click on send usage

135
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,929
statistics if you like now depending

136
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,459
where you are if you're in the UK or one

137
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,379
of the European countries that are

138
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,539
affected or the recent changes to data

139
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,339
privacy you may also get a privacy

140
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,769
pop-up which you'll need to agree to

141
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:19,879
before continuing but because I'm in

142
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,979
Australia I'm not affected by that and I

143
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,839
didn't get that option next you'll get

144
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,999
access to this screen this is a series

145
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:28,399
of customizations now for IntelliJ now

146
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,449
keep in mind with all of these things

147
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,610
that you can configure these at a later

148
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,869
times you don't need to spend a lot of

149
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,759
time thinking about this and usually

150
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,779
you'll see on the screen there's an

151
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,489
option that tells you how to get access

152
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:39,499
to these things to change in the future

153
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:41,419
this one is the background I'm going to

154
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,339
click on IntelliJ this is white

155
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,839
background which tends to be better for

156
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,209
video you can choose either click on

157
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,179
next now this screen gives you a list of

158
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,149
default plugins for IntelliJ one thing

159
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,469
you'll find with IntelliJ it's very

160
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,749
versatile and there's lots of different

161
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:58,550
plugins that you can install to add

162
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,749
various functionality

163
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:01,339
what I suggest here is you just leave

164
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,439
everything as the default noting that

165
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,059
you can change this again in the future

166
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:07,009
and one other note to keep in mind here

167
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,899
is if you're installing the ultimate

168
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:10,819
edition of IntelliJ you'll find that

169
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,009
there's more options on this screen in

170
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,639
both cases I just recommend you click on next

171
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,529
same deal on this screen you can install

172
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,479
these things if you want to but I

173
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,559
suggest you leave them and you can

174
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,299
always come back later to do that I'm

175
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,829
going to click on start now using

176
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:29,059
IntelliJ IDEA so we've now loaded

177
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,369
IntelliJ for the first time next thing

178
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,360
we want to do now is we want to

179
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,069
associate the Java development kit that

180
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,439
we installed in the previous video so

181
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,689
come down here click on configure click

182
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,119
on project defaults and click on project

183
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,839
structure this gives us the screen here

184
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:48,110
and we need to now define or select the

185
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,490
software development kit that we want to

186
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,810
use, so you may need to click on SDKs

187
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,389
here but usually from project will be

188
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,430
have to do the same thing so we'll just

189
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,570
click on this little drop down we can

190
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,190
confirm that there's no SDK or software

191
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,500
development kit installed so I'm going

192
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,320
to click on new I'm going to select JDK

193
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,669
because we want to install a new Java

194
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:08,669
development kit all he set it up then we

195
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,400
need to navigate to the folder where the

196
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,930
JDK was installed you remember that

197
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,700
remember that I discussed that in the

198
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,050
last video and showed you where that was

199
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,150
in most cases that will be in the C

200
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,790
Drive Program Files noting that I'm not

201
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,950
selecting Program Files x86 that's a

202
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,070
different folder altogether Java and JDK

203
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,440
so I'm going to select a JDK now

204
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,760
depending on the version you've

205
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,800
downloaded the numbers will change you

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
can see here that I've got an older

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,820
version here Java 8 1.8 means Java

208
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,310
version 8 that would be situation yet

209
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,780
that's that would be the one you choose

210
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,240
if you have a 32-bit version of Windows

211
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,820
but in my case I had a 64-bit version of

212
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,530
Windows running and I'm gonna just click

213
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,200
on this first option here for JDK making

214
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,520
sure that it's the latest version that

215
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,650
is available in this in this folder

216
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,720
one other thing make sure you don't

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,960
click the JRE, JRE stands for Runtime

218
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,990
Edition, Java Runtime Edition JDK is Java

219
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,669
development kit, you need to click on the

220
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,000
Java development kit click on OK and you

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,780
can see now that we've got a

222
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,850
configuration here whereas before it

223
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,039
said no JDK we've got Java 10 showing

224
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,780
the other thing is just to make sure you

225
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,310
select the right version here the

226
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:14,970
project level

227
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,340
it's normally auto selected for you in

228
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,860
my case you can see it's set to 10 and

229
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,240
that means that we're going to be using

230
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,400
the features of Java 10 if you had to

231
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,740
install a JDK 8 you would select a

232
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,750
version 8, in my case version 10 is

233
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,410
correct so I'm gonna click on ok so

234
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,640
we've now configured to the Java

235
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,349
development kit there's just a few other

236
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:36,900
settings to configure that I recommend

237
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,610
you set and you get access to those I'm

238
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,469
going to click on configure and select

239
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,490
settings once that pops up we want to

240
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,760
come down to editor click on the little

241
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,620
triangle there to expand it then come

242
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,029
down to general and click that as well

243
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,300
and then click on auto import 2 very

244
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,400
useful checkboxes to check here would be

245
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,920
the add and an unambiguous imports on

246
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,320
the fly and optimize imports on the fly

247
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,910
at the current project or select you,

248
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,980
I suggest you configure both of those or

249
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,649
select both

250
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,240
those come down to appearance I suggest

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,920
you click on I might will make sure that

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,660
the show line numbers checkbox is

253
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,759
checked in this case you can see that it

254
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,839
is checked and I don't need to do

255
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,879
anything there and finally come down

256
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,100
here to code folding and what I

257
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,170
recommend you do here is I recommend you

258
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,860
take off the check boxes for closures

259
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,259
and for generic constructor and method

260
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,600
parameters and the reason will become

261
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,889
apparent is to go through the course it

262
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:34,449
just makes sure that tell the code that

263
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,459
we're writing isn't being hidden away by

264
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,920
IntelliJ, alright once I click on ok and that

265
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,660
will save those changes in your

266
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,550
configuration and it means that all

267
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,949
future projects that you create when the

268
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,410
IntelliJ will use those settings. Alright,

269
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,759
so this point we're done we've now

270
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,769
configured IntelliJ IDEA and you're

271
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:54,360
ready to move on now to the next video.
