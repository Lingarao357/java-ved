1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,509
In this video we're going to download

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,019
and install the Java development kit, JDK

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,670
for a linux platform. Now I'm running

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,370
this on Ubuntu 16.04 but it should work

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,220
without any issues on later versions,

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,170
so what we need to do is go to a command

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,369
line I'm going to open the command

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,900
window close down this browser and we're

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,890
going to do is we're gonna start by

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,930
typing sudo space a it add apt

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,140
repository space ppa:linuxuprising

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,110
slash Java type in your

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,610
password press enter next we're gonna

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,789
type sudo space apt - get space update

15
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:05,280
press Enter you met a moment to complete

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,840
you know when that's finished we're

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,740
gonna type sudo space apt - get space

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,740
install space Oracle

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,420
- Java 10 - install, so obviously I'm

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,580
installing Java 10 here and you will

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,810
occasionally get a message like that you

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,520
can try that again if you get the same

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,680
problem, I found you can actually close

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,020
down to exit and open a terminal session

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,570
again and top the command again sudo

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,710
space apt - get space install space

27
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:44,160
Oracle Java 10 - install password and

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,990
you have no luck with that again this

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,390
does happen from time to time we can try

30
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,880
configure gate manually but I was quite

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,229
honestly the easiest way to get around

32
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,940
this is just to restart your

33
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,320
installation, so I'm going to do that I'm

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,259
gonna click on shutdown and then restart

35
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,810
restart Ubuntu and once they restart we

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,460
should find that that error has

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,970
disappeared. Okay, I'm gonna login

38
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,380
can't get over my terminal again third

39
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,170
time lucky we're going to type just that

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,170
through command again sudo space apt -

41
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,220
get space install space then it's Oracle

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,540
- Java 10 - install type in my password

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,650
you can see that this time it's actually

44
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,110
worked, some I click on type y

45
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,200
center and what's happening now is it's

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,030
downloading, you can see they're added now

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,980
configuring the Oracle Java 10

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,480
installers I'm gonna click ok there by

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,090
pressing enter I'm gonna move the arrow

50
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,800
and I've used press the left arrow to

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,940
select yes and press enter

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,900
accepted the license as you can see it's

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,550
now downloading Java 10 from Oracle's

54
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,190
website so that's going to take live a

55
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,420
while it's going to take a few minutes

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,330
as you can see before that completes the

57
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,680
good thing about this process is it's

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,900
quite fast and there's no other steps

59
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,820
there's another alternative where you

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,230
can manually install the the JDK if you

61
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,140
prefer to use the open JDK version

62
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,090
instead of Oracle's version what I'll do

63
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,760
is I'll post some notes in the resources

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,470
section of this video if you want to do

65
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,200
that instead of downloading Oracle's

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,700
version of Java.

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,530
You can see the Downloads complete now,

68
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,849
and it's now going through the process

69
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,310
of installing the downloaded version of

70
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,280
Java 10 to this installation and at this

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,599
point we've now finished the

72
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,220
configuration and you can see there's

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,420
always have an additional command to

74
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,970
type there to setup JDK 10 as the

75
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,650
default so I'm going to do that I going

76
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,040
to type sudo space apt space install

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,140
space Oracle

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,299
- Java 10 - set - default press enter

79
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,170
there we've now set to have a ten to be

80
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,180
the default installation of Java on this

81
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,160
computer, we can verify that by typing

82
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,049
Java space - - version and you can see

83
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:12,340
it shows us and confirms that we're

84
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,640
running Java version 10.0

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,829
in this computer. Alright so that's the

86
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,600
installation of the Java development kit

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,880
a complete, in the next video what we

88
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,430
need to do is download and install the

89
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,530
IDE or integrated development

90
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,090
environment, so we're going to be using

91
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,340
on this computer to write programs and

92
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,370
then IDE is called IntelliJ IDEA so

93
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,930
let's work on that in the next video.
