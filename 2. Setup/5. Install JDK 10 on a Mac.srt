1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,690
In this video we're going to download

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,970
and install the Java development kit for

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,580
a Mac computer and if you're running on

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,099
Windows or a Linux machine refer to the

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,320
separate videos in this course for those

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
operating systems but if you're on a Mac

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,050
go to Java sun.com in a browser once you

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,619
get there select Java SE we come over

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
here and select or click Java platform

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,489
SDK, and click on accept license

11
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,829
agreement come over to the back version

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,190
click on that and select save to start

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,309
the download. Now the version that I will

14
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,770
show on this page may change as of the

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,780
time that I'm recording this video you

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,309
can see that it's got Java SE

17
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,430
development kit 10.0.1 so that is

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,649
the most current release but if you've

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,300
got a later version or you see a later

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,239
version on this page just select that

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,760
and download that version because things

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,680
will still work just fine in this course.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,780
Alright so I'm going to pause now until

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,580
this download is complete and then we'll

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,820
go through the installation process.

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,740
Alright so the download is now complete so

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,790
I'm going to come down here and click on

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,400
the dmg file to open it

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,270
and then we're going to start with the

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,040
installation I'm gonna double click on

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,370
this icon to start it we click on

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,650
continue I'm going to click on install

33
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:37,230
type in my password and then start the

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,620
installation after I press enter.

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,440
I can click on close, now this option that

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,170
will either delete the file that you

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,060
download it or put it into the trash or

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,070
you can optionally select to I keep it

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,600
this can be useful to keep it if you

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,250
plan to install this on another computer

41
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,200
just to save you having to download it

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,850
in my case, I'm just going to click

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,690
on move to trash and installations now

44
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,729
completed I can close down that window

45
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,490
as well. So in the next video

46
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,600
now that we've installed Java

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,399
development kit we need to download

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,130
install and configure the actual program

49
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,959
we're going to be using to create Java

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,880
applications in this course and that's

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,550
called IntelliJ IDEA. So let's work on

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,690
that in the next video.
