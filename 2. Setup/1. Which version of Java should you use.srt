1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,189
So in this section of the course,

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:09,080
we're going to download and install the right

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,959
version of the JDK and that's the job of

4
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,940
a developer's kit and then the program

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,219
we're going to use to write out Java

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,759
programs which is IntelliJ IDEA.

7
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,559
Now downloading and installing the right

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,480
version of Java has become a little more

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,869
complicated due to Oracle now releasing

10
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,059
new versions of Java every six months

11
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,460
instead of what used to happen when the

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,050
new version only came up once every two

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,090
to three years, but don't worry because

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,530
I'm going to make this as painless as

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,650
possible for you as we move forward,

16
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,050
so which version of Java or the JDK should

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,600
you install. Well, in general my advice is

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,610
to download the most recent version of

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,090
Java. As you can see on this page the

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,100
most current version of Java available

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,370
is Java 10 I recommend you download and

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,980
use that version of Java but note that

23
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,440
two other versions of Java are available

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,739
to download on this page Java 9 and Java 8.

25
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:06,680
So firstly Java 9 is not

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,079
recommended to use since Oracle I know

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,060
now are no longer providing support for

28
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,490
it but what about Java 8? Why is that

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,369
also an option for you to download?

30
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,679
Now the reason for this is that Java 8 is

31
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,249
the current LTS version of Java and LTS

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,499
stands for long-term support, so Oracle

33
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:26,810
who are the owners of Java are providing

34
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,090
updates to this version until at least

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,590
January 2019. Now on the other hand, Java 9

36
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,630
well it's already had its final

37
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,959
release in January 2018 and has now been

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,329
retired and will not be updated any

39
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,389
further, so Java 10 will then itself be

40
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:47,029
replaced by the next long-term support

41
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:50,179
version of Java which is Java 11 coming

42
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,599
out in September 2018. So as you can see

43
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,700
most versions of Java will be retired

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,670
within six months of their release with

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,249
the exception being the LTS or long term

46
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,560
support versions. The currently Java 8

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,709
has long term support and Java 11 is

48
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,170
proposed to have LTS when it comes out

49
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,780
later in the year. Now if all this sounds

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,599
confusing. blame Oracle. Seriously though,

51
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,610
well in doubt just download the latest

52
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,960
version of Java

53
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,090
that you see on this page when you visit.

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,860
Now the installation videos we'll go

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,330
through this in detail, so don't think

56
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,040
you need to install that now how do you

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,570
suggest you watch the installation

58
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,430
videos for your operating system

59
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,680
in this section of the course.

60
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Now speaking of those installation videos

61
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,210
you'll actually see Java 8 referred to

62
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,790
in those videos but in general again my

63
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,010
recommendation is to install the very

64
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,620
latest version of Java you see on the

65
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,350
page when you go and visit and something

66
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,390
else to blame Oracle 4 here is that

67
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,430
there is an exception to this, if you've

68
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,710
got a 32-bit version of Windows or Linux.

69
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,440
Now, in your situation you'll have to

70
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,660
download and use the 32-bit version of

71
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,660
Java 8. Now the reason for that is the

72
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,930
newer Java versions do not have a 32-bit

73
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,760
version available for download and

74
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,020
apparently Oracle in their infinite

75
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,330
wisdom have decided not to offer that

76
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,030
from any version of Java from Java 9

77
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,220
onwards but that's the only exception in

78
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,920
in all other cases just go ahead and

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,330
download the very latest version of Java.

80
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,630
Now this video will be updated as needed

81
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,160
when Oracle changes anything and

82
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,270
hopefully that won't change anything

83
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,750
else now, but do note though irrespective

84
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,850
of what version of Java you download and

85
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,770
use you can follow along and get the

86
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,350
maximum value from this course.

87
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,910
Every thing's going to work fine, you

88
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,110
won't have a problem with your version

89
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,080
of Java and in addition, as new versions

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,120
of Java come out I'll actually be adding

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,700
a section dealing with the changes

92
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,040
specific to that version of Java and the

93
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,330
changes made to it

94
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,370
for those of you who want to know what

95
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,290
has changed and be able to take

96
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,250
advantage of some of the features

97
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,190
available in those new versions. So in

98
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,740
summary, so pick the very latest version

99
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,260
of Java that's available for you when

100
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,730
you get through to that download page

101
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,070
and refer to the installation videos in

102
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,420
this section for more details.

103
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,910
The only exception again is Windows and

104
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,100
Linux users if you've got a 32-bit

105
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,960
version of your operating system you'll

106
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,840
need to download Java 8 only but

107
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,489
again refer to your installation videos

108
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,980
for more details and finally

109
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,420
irrespective of the version of Java that

110
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,670
you download install, you still will be

111
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,560
able to make full use of all videos in

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,290
this course. So it's now time to move on,

113
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,510
your next steps now is to watch the

114
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,430
separate installation videos

115
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,110
your operating system, you know there's

116
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,330
wonderful windows another for Mac and

117
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,070
the third for Linux and you want to do

118
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,720
that for both the installation of the

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
Java development kit the JDK as well as

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,670
the IDE and in case you're wondering IDE

121
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,140
stands for integrated development

122
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,880
environment which is really just a fancy

123
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,350
word for the program we're going to be

124
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,540
using to write java code in this course

125
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,360
and that's IntelliJ IDEA. So once you do

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,440
that with both of those installations

127
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,840
follow along you'd be good to go and be

128
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,120
able to start writing some Java code.

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,890
So the windows installation video for the

130
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,420
Java development kit is coming up

131
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,580
immediately after this video so if

132
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,230
you're a Mac or Linux user you want to

133
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,450
skip ahead to the relevant video and get

134
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,920
in this section of the course to get

135
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,110
started for your operating system

136
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,910
otherwise, if you're a Windows user watch

137
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,620
the next video and we'll make a start.
