1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,440
In this video we're going to download and

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,680
install IntelliJ which is the IDE or

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,870
integrated development environment that

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,980
we're going to be using in this course

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,800
to create our Java programs. Now this

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,869
video is for a Mac so if you're on a

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:20,180
Windows machine or a Linux machine refer

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,650
to the appropriate video for your

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,880
operating system as there are a few

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,860
differences when it comes to downloading

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,399
and installing. Okay so in the browser

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,130
firstly you wanna go to JetBrains.com

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,509
and JetBrains is the name of the company

14
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,120
who have created this product we're

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,539
going to be using IntelliJ IDEA once we

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,649
get to that page when I click on tools

17
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,000
they want to come over here to IntelliJ

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,070
IDEA and click that and that brings us

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,230
to a page with information relating to

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,809
IntelliJ. Now there's two versions of

21
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,909
IntelliJ that we can install and if we

22
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:57,289
scroll it towards the bottom of the page

23
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,149
you can see that there's a comparison

24
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,149
chart between the two versions so we've

25
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,250
got the Ultimate Edition for web and

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,870
Enterprise Development and the Community

27
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,790
Edition for JVM which are a virtual

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,979
machine and Android development now the

29
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:11,390
differences are the Ultimate Edition is

30
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,909
a paid version of IntelliJ if we scroll

31
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:14,930
down a little bit you can see there's a

32
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,960
free trial available but after that the

33
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,460
trial period has expired

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,990
you will need to pay for the product

35
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,420
that's the Ultimate Edition, the

36
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,280
Community Edition on the other hand has

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,500
less features but is completely free and

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,790
open source and you'll never need to pay

39
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,560
for it. In this course the community

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,990
version will suffice there's really no

41
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,360
reason to buy the Ultimate Edition but

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,409
if you want to do that for some reason

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,600
you can take the trial the other thing I

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,270
can do is that I can extend the trial by

45
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,600
90 days to give you a total of 120 days

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,060
trial of the Ultimate Edition but in my

47
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,350
case what I'm going to do is download

48
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,180
the free community edition I'm gonna

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,240
click on download give that a moment to

50
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,840
start and I'm just going to save it to

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,329
my computer and I'll pause the video now

52
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,740
we'll come back once it's fully

53
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,450
downloaded and we'll continue on with

54
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,200
the installation and configuration.

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,850
Okay, so the download is now complete so I'm

56
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,500
going to come over here and click on the

57
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,930
dmg file which will start the

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,450
installation process on my back and I'm

59
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,800
gonna take the opportunity to close down

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,450
the browser since we're finished with

61
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,110
the download,

62
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,330
once it starts we've got the option to

63
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,820
install and all we need to do is click

64
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,640
on the IntelliJ seee icon holding the

65
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,660
button down and drag it to the

66
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,380
Applications folder and release

67
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,730
and the installation is now completed so

68
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm going to close this down and what

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm going to do is start IntelliJ so I'm

70
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,040
going to do is now open a window go to

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
my Applications folder and I'm going to

72
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,740
choose IntelliJ seee which is the

73
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,920
Community Edition that I've downloaded

74
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,760
double click that to start the

75
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,500
installation process,

76
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,520
okay when this option comes up we're

77
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,910
going to click on open and the first

78
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,350
time you've installed IntelliJ IDEA

79
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,840
you've got the option here to import the

80
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,360
settings from another custom location or

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,120
to not import any settings in this case

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,040
I haven't got anywhere else to load the

83
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,360
settings from so I'm going to leave the

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,190
default option selected dunno the import

85
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,360
settings and click ok. Now between when

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,130
I've clicked ok and this screen popping

87
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,050
up if you're in the Europe and you're

88
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,910
affected by the recent Tubb privacy

89
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,370
updates that are carrying in May 2018

90
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,920
you may see a pop-up asking you to

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,010
accept privacy terms and conditions so

92
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,350
that does pop up for you accept those in

93
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,880
my case because up on Australia I'm not

94
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,230
affected so I don't need to select

95
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,760
anything and then you'll move on and

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,320
you'll get to the screen this screen

97
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,210
gives you the option of a siding a theme

98
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,760
for IntelliJ and essentially what it is

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,530
is just the color style or theme that's

100
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,200
going to be used during development.

101
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,700
Now keep in mind I'm gonna select light here

102
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,650
keep in mind that you can change these

103
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,970
appearances later and it gives you the

104
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,160
options here on how to find out how to

105
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,470
do that by going to appearances

106
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,210
appearance of behavior and appearance so

107
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,140
that's where you'll change it if you

108
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,160
like but I'm going to select that

109
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,580
default and click on next on this screen

110
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,070
you select the key map scheme in almost

111
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,170
all cases you'll select the option on

112
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,880
the left hand side I've never used ID

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,400
and just let the default key map for

114
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,520
IntelliJ IDEA so next this screen gives

115
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,010
you the ability to run the IntelliJ IDEA

116
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,870
from the command line I'm not going to

117
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,250
be doing that in this course because I

118
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,020
prefer to start the GUI interface and

119
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,330
load my code and projects etc from there

120
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,920
but if for some reason you want to be

121
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
over the ability to run IntelliJ from

122
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,370
the command line this would be where

123
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,060
you'd select that click on next

124
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,770
so IntelliJ IDEA is a very versatile

125
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,570
program, it's got lots of different

126
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,220
plugins and settings that you can

127
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,930
configure and this screens giving you

128
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,150
the ability to choose some and basically

129
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,680
the list of tools that are enabled by

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
default. Now what I suggest you do here

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,490
is just leave everything else is and

132
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,830
move on to the next screen noting that

133
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,880
you can always install additional

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,520
plugins and uninstall them etc later on

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,350
the other thing I want to point out here

136
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,260
is if you're running the intelligent

137
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,450
edition of IntelliJ IDEA you'll see that

138
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,950
that'll have even more options than what

139
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,210
the ones than the ones that I was

140
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,949
actually showing here that's because

141
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,150
because you're paying for the ultimate

142
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,949
edition they give you extra plugins and

143
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,810
so forth to use in this case I'm just

144
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,880
going to click on next

145
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,530
same deal here with the featured plugins

146
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,060
I'm going to leave everything as its

147
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,069
default but if you wanted to you can

148
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,389
make a change but again you can always

149
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:27,949
go back into preferences plugins later

150
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,349
and configure things at some future

151
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,150
point in time, so I'm going to click on

152
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,919
start using IntelliJ IDEA at this point

153
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,110
we've now got IntelliJ IDEA installed.

154
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,880
Now what we need to do is make some

155
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,370
configuration changes, firstly to I

156
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,650
configure the Java development kit so

157
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,599
that works with IntelliJ and then

158
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:48,860
there's a few other settings we need to

159
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,199
make so to get access to the JDK we're

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,479
gonna click on configure select project

161
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,610
defaults and select the project

162
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,580
structure that brings up this screen

163
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,740
here and initially when we go in here

164
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,919
you'll see that it says no SDK ok on the

165
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,750
drop down there's nothing there so what

166
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,190
we need to do is configure the Java

167
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,990
development kit to work with IntelliJ

168
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,050
IDEA click on new to do that, we select

169
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,979
JDK got lots of options here because

170
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,440
IntelliJ IDEA is a versatile IDE that

171
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,310
works with a number of different

172
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,250
languages but we want the JDK here so

173
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,159
click on that and what should happen is

174
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,969
that IntelliJ IDEA should find the

175
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,430
installation of JDK 10 that we've only

176
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,669
just installed in the previous video so

177
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,360
right click the drop down here you can

178
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,500
see that if I come down here and have a

179
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,120
look in jdk 10.01, jdk so that's the jdk

180
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,409
that we installed and it should update

181
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,509
and find the one for you automatically

182
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,180
if not you'd go to your library folder

183
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,190
as you can see there select java java

184
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,919
virtual machines you choose the jdk and

185
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,479
going to the contents home for her but

186
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,520
in my case it found it automatically so

187
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,550
i just need to click on open and you can

188
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,449
see what's happened there now that

189
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,849
that's been selected you can see we've

190
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,820
now got a project SDK here now showing

191
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,530
Java 10, the other thing you want to make

192
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,750
sure you've selected here is to set the

193
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,900
SDK at the default in my case you can

194
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,919
see that it did actually sell it

195
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,020
automatically but it should be set to 10

196
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,969
which may basically means you get access

197
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:21,830
to all the features for that particular

198
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,320
version of Java. Alright so at this point

199
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,040
that's now

200
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,170
complete so click on ok to save those

201
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,080
settings and we're nearly finished now

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,260
there's just a few other configuration

203
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,730
settings we need to set before we can

204
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,650
start actually creating some Java

205
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,750
programs so to get access to those

206
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,060
settings we're going to configure you

207
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,780
want to click on preferences next we

208
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,220
want to come down here and they click on

209
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,650
the little triangle next to editor click

210
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,850
on it again the one that's next to

211
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,270
general then click on auto import

212
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,410
there's two options here add an

213
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,630
ambiguous imports on-the-fly check that

214
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,000
there's also optimized imports on the

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,370
fly for current project click on check

216
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,260
that box as well and without going into

217
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,970
too much detail at the moment it just

218
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,500
makes things a little bit easier to work

219
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,660
with by automating some of the things

220
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,800
that say you would perhaps have to have

221
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,900
done manually as a Java developer in the

222
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,250
past we'll talk more about that when we

223
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,170
get to that appropriate stage in the

224
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,230
course, next we want to come down to

225
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,360
appearance and click on appearance you

226
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,400
want to make sure that show align

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,410
numbers is checked unless you can see in

228
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,360
my case it was checked by default but if

229
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
it's not checked on your installations

230
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,810
for whatever reason make sure you check

231
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,790
that and finally when it come down here

232
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,520
to code folding you click on that and

233
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,620
you want to make sure here is that

234
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,470
closures is deselected and uncheck that

235
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,720
and also generic constructor and method

236
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,250
parameters we're gonna uncheck that as

237
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,650
well, so what code following is it's

238
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,450
actually hiding some of the source code

239
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,580
that programmers don't need to access

240
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,440
very often but in our particular case

241
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,210
because we're starting out learning Java

242
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,430
it's best that we see all the code and

243
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,860
that the IDE doesn't try to

244
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,270
hide anything from us so that's why

245
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,190
we've done that and the other thing here

246
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,420
is you're going to also take the check

247
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,690
box off one-line methods once we've done

248
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,000
that we can click on ok and at this

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,350
point, we're now fully configured

250
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,410
IntelliJ IDEA and the JDK and we're

251
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,020
ready to start creating our first Java

252
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,540
program. So let's end the video here in

253
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,730
the next video it's time to start

254
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,590
writing as I mentioned the Java program

255
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,050
so you want to skip this the videos that

256
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,780
relate to setting up the JDK and

257
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
IntelliJ IDEA for different platforms

258
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,070
because we're now set up and configured

259
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,630
on the Mac and you can move on then

260
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,760
those videos and go to the next video

261
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,010
when we start talking about creating

262
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,170
some programs, so I'll see you in the next video.
