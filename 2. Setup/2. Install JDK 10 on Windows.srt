1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,839
In this video we're going to download

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,420
and install the Java development kit for

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,639
the Windows platform, so if you're on a

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,250
Mac or running on a Linux system refer

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,410
to the relevant video elsewhere in this

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,210
course because the steps are a little

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,220
bit different but if you're on Windows

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,890
start by going to your browser and going

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,920
to the website java.sun.com

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,720
once you get there that you see this

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,250
option over here for downloads you can

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,790
come over here and select Java SE that

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,220
brings you to this page here and for

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,110
most users you'll select this Java

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,780
platform JDK and currently you can see

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,520
as of the time of recording this video

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,190
is showing version 10 so if you're

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,290
seeing a later version then do install

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,239
that later version but there is one

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,980
caveat to that and that's if you're

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,070
running a 32-bit version of Windows.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,750
Now if you are running a 32-bit version of

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,400
Windows you'll need to actually download

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,089
an older version of Java the JDK because

25
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,520
Oracle no longer supporting 32-bit

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,560
versions of Windows for our current

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,410
versions of Java or the JDK so to

28
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,720
determine if you're running a 32-bit or

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,180
a 64-bit version of Windows when it go

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,009
into your control panel I'm going to

31
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,960
right click the windows icon and select

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,700
settings that usually works for most

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,310
versions of Windows then you want to go

34
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,550
into system, the select system

35
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,290
already because I'm running Windows 10,

36
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,210
I can actually type system and then got an

37
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,680
option down here to click on about your

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,990
PC, so you may write if you're running an

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,120
older version of windows need to go to

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,260
system and then there's an option for

41
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,780
about any respective you should get

42
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,040
eventually to a screen that looks very

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,110
similar to this you can see it down here

44
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,650
under system type it says for me

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,900
64-bit operating system x64 based

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,270
processor so the important part is a bit

47
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,729
on the left which says 64-bit operating

48
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,770
system so that tells me that I'm running

49
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,380
a 64-bit version and therefore I can run

50
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,869
the later versions of the JDK but yours

51
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,630
is a 32-bit operating system then you'll

52
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,909
need to install the older version of the

53
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,799
JDK which I'll show you when we go back

54
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:10,929
to the browser how to get access to that.

55
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:12,600
Alright so let's close this down and

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,070
back in the browser so if yours said

57
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,350
64-bit version then you'd come down and

58
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,450
click on here download Java platform SDK

59
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,100
10 come down and click on accept license

60
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,930
agreement and select over here the

61
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,380
windows 64-bit version I'm going to save

62
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,890
that into my downloads folder so while

63
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,570
that's downloading if you found that

64
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,040
you're running a 32-bit version of

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,989
Windows then what you need to do is just

66
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,650
go back and not download this version 10

67
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,450
come back to this screen and scroll down

68
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,440
and you'll see that you'll have this

69
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,209
option is quite a little bit more for

70
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,400
version eight so come over to version

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,319
eight click on JDK download then you

72
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,540
have this option you can scroll down you

73
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,930
can accept license agreement and you can

74
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,190
come down here this time you select the

75
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,400
x86 version which is a 32-bit version

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,020
you'd select that version there and

77
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,959
download a that version check it out

78
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,340
working on your computer but again

79
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,360
that's only if you're running a 32-bit

80
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,040
version of Windows.

81
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,780
In my case you can see the download for

82
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,700
the 64-bit version has finished so I'm

83
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
going to click on that to open it so

84
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,959
basically just open the file you just

85
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,310
downloaded ok yes if you get the pop-up

86
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,019
to run the program I'm going to close a

87
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,630
browser down at this point

88
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,340
then we'll give the Java installation

89
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,790
process a chance to start ok so you can

90
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,790
see we got this wizard now so the first

91
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,330
steps is to go through and click on next

92
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,650
then like this folder you'll need to

93
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,299
possibly know this folders on my case

94
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,700
that's downloading to Program Files Java

95
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,980
JDK version 10 so I'm gonna click on

96
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,980
next then we'll let it go through and

97
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,980
install that version of Java and you do

98
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,359
a similar thing if you downloaded the

99
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,780
older version of the JDK the

100
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,130
installation steps are very much similar

101
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,019
to what you're seeing here you'd follow

102
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,700
those steps and you can see that it's

103
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,480
downloading and installing also the JRE

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,160
JRE stands for the Java Runtime edition

105
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,200
so installing Java and it's also

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,030
installing the JDK you need both on your

107
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,790
computer, click on next there again

108
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,900
these steps will be very similar

109
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,400
irrespective of whether you're running

110
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,789
the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the JDK,

111
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:30,020
in other words JDK 8 or JDK 10.

112
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,490
Alright so you'll see at this point

113
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,039
now the installation is now complete we

114
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,860
can click on close and that's the end of

115
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,629
the video in the next one we're going to

116
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,270
download install and configure the IDE

117
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,220
or integrated development environment

118
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,629
that we're going to be using to write

119
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,000
Java programs in this course,see you in

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,509
the next video.
