1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,740
In this video we're going to download

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,980
install and configure the IDE IntelliJ

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,870
IDEA that we're going to be using in

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,780
this course to write Java programs.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,910
Now this video is for a Linux platform so if

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,710
you're on another operating system do

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,960
refer to the relevant video for your

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
operating system but if you're running

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,920
Linux, then open a browser then want to

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,769
go to www.jetbrains.com. Now JetBrains are the

11
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,890
people who have created IntelliJ IDEA so

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,510
once you get to that site click on tools

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,659
come over here and click on IntelliJ IDEA,

14
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,129
then IntelliJ IDEA comes in two versions

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,260
if we scroll down and have a look we can

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,489
find out some more information about

17
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:52,010
what each version is all about, you can

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,390
see that we've got an Ultimate Edition

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,220
here for web and enterprise development

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,830
and a community edition, the JVM and

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,080
Android development license top is

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,030
commercial the Ultimate Edition an

23
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,760
open-source for the Community Edition so

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,900
effectively what that means is the

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,970
Community Edition is free and we can

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,030
confirm that down here and the ultimate

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,039
edition gives you a trial period after

28
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,390
the trial expires will then need to

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,640
purchase that software, by default the

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
Ultimate Edition gives you a 30-day

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,020
trial I can extend that by another 90

32
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,259
days to a total of 100 120 days if you

33
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,060
want to try out the Ultimate Edition but

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,439
that's your choice either one will work

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
I recommend that the Community Edition

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,140
is quite acceptable and everything that

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,340
we do with this course will work just

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,649
fine with that edition. So that's reason

39
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm going to click on download for the

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,200
Community Edition

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,729
and I'm going to save that so I'll saved

42
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,240
to my download directory and we'll start

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,810
that once that's finished.

44
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,920
Alright first you can see the download

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,900
is now complete, so I'm going to come

46
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,970
over here and click on the little folder

47
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,700
there to open the folder and we need to

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,310
decide on a location where we're going

49
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,050
to install this. Now where exactly

50
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,820
install it is up to you what I'm going

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,650
to do is click on my home folder I'm

52
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,960
going to create a new folder and call it dev

53
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,000
and we're going to put that in IntelliJ

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,580
IDEA as a subfolder from that folder

55
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,300
that's where I'm going to put all my

56
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,459
development tools, so I don't I'm not

57
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,990
going to go to downloads I'm going to

58
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,290
double click the archive the target GZ

59
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,630
file to open it then I'm going to

60
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,510
extract that and then you go back to my

61
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,209
home folder into my dev folder I'm going

62
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,680
to extract it into that folder I need to

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,870
click on close I'm going to close down

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,420
the extractor now we're finished with

65
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,320
that I'm also going to take the

66
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,820
opportunity to close down this screen as

67
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,860
well we've done with that as well

68
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,320
and the browser what we're going to do

69
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,510
now is go to the command bar line our

70
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,370
terminal session and we're going to

71
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,380
start IntelliJ IDEA for the first time

72
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,830
via the command line let's go ahead and

73
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,239
do that so I'm going to first go into

74
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
the folder it's on a CD space

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,910
forward slash dev slash I'm going to

76
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,400
type I and press tab and then we'll go

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,200
into the quad folder for the IntelliJ

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,959
automatically then I'm going to type CD

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,930
space bin and they're going to type ls,

80
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,930
press enter and that's now the bin

81
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,110
folder which contains the versions,

82
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,850
I mean version of IntelliJ that we want to

83
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,700
run so going to type a period forward

84
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,860
slash idea

85
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,560
dot sh that's the script to startup

86
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,500
idea IntelliJ IDEA for the first time as

87
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,670
it's standing up you can see here

88
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,380
there's asking us whether we want to

89
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,690
import IntelliJ IDEA settings from

90
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,850
another location or what do we not want

91
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,620
to import settings I'm going to choose

92
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,450
do not import but if you do have a

93
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,519
location wave installed an installation

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,860
of IntelliJ IDEA previously and you want

95
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,540
to retain the settings you would choose

96
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,370
that folder and IntelliJ would

97
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,829
automatically install those settings but

98
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,900
I'm just going to click on ok with the

99
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
option do not import settings checked

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,330
next you may or may not get this update

101
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,220
this is the privacy policy that

102
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,350
appears and I'm just going to screw it

103
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,980
into the bottom here and click on accept

104
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,600
next we'll get data sharing I'm gonna

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,160
click on don't send but if you want to

106
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,780
share statistics for some reason you can

107
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,490
choose that I'm going to look on don't

108
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,250
send next we get to the stage where

109
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,109
we're doing some initial customization

110
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,690
our IntelliJ IDEA, you can see this

111
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,910
option here gives us dark color IntelliJ

112
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,660
IDEA and gtk+ you got three styles or

113
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,430
themes that you can choose the one that

114
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,290
I generally like is the IntelliJ one so

115
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,240
that's what I'm going to select keep in

116
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,470
mind you can also change these settings

117
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,170
later by going into settings appearance

118
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,510
and behavior and appearance, so click on

119
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,660
next, so next is saying do we want to

120
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,300
create a desktop entry to make it easier

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,730
to start this from the GUI interface

122
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,480
definitely I want that so I'm going to

123
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,670
leave the default selected there if for

124
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,600
some reason you don't want to do that

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,730
now go into tools and create desktop

126
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,110
entries how you get access to that

127
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,090
within IntelliJ at a later stage

128
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,780
click on next the launcher script can be

129
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,000
handy if you're often in the command

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,190
line and you want to invoke IntelliJ

131
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,960
from the command line or open a

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,790
particular file from the command line

133
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,710
I generally don't do that I generally

134
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,960
just starting intelliJ and then do all my

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,730
phone navigation and opening of projects

136
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,770
within the GUI interface if for some

137
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,150
reason you want the script you check

138
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,190
that I'm gonna leave it unchecked click

139
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,310
on next default plugins here we get a

140
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,500
list of default plugins they're going to

141
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,210
be configured and installed by IntelliJ

142
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,979
generally I suggest you leave this

143
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,590
because you can always go ahead and

144
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,790
install plugins at your leisure or

145
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,580
install plugins within the settings in a

146
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,140
later time so I'm gonna leave the

147
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,120
default they're just one quick thing to

148
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,620
keep in mind is if you installed the

149
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,660
Ultimate Edition you will follow there's

150
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,190
a lot more options that are shown on the

151
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,419
screen than the ones you can see here.

152
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,660
Alright so gonna click on next

153
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,160
same deal here with featured plugins I

154
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,410
suggest you leave it as is but you can

155
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,150
select install them if that's what you

156
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,620
want to do but I'm not going to do

157
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,580
anything there I was going to click

158
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,710
start using IntelliJ IDEA

159
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,660
so at that point the basic installation

160
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,310
of IntelliJ IDEA was now complete but

161
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,930
there's a few other things we need to

162
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,729
configure, firstly we need to be

163
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,370
configure IntelliJ IDEA to point it to

164
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,289
the Java development kit so that could

165
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,660
find the Java development kit so that we

166
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,090
can create Java programs so to do that

167
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,370
we're gonna click on configure I'm going

168
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,830
to click on project defaults we're going

169
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,789
to select project structure that brings

170
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,590
this screen up and what we didn't want

171
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,720
to do is come over here you should find

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,039
if we click on the drop box there's no

173
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,530
other SDK so in other words until today

174
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,419
ID hasn't configured anything so I'm

175
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,000
going to come over here and click on new,

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,099
now IntelliJ IDEA and that was you to

177
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,979
edit code in a variety of languages so

178
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,690
when we click on new for a project SDK,

179
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,750
we need to choose the type and you may may

180
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,949
or may not have all these options or you

181
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,690
may even have additional options I'm

182
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,240
going to select JDK since we configuring

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,900
IntelliJ IDE for Java. Now you notice

184
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,840
what happened then automatically

185
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,639
IntelliJ IDEA found our java 10

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,770
installation and that should generally

187
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,389
be the case for you and you shouldn't

188
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,979
need to configure it so I'm just going

189
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,010
to click on ok there we've got Java 10

190
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,710
configured but if for some reason it

191
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,630
wasn't automatically configured you just

192
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,280
need to navigate to the folder where

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,889
Java 10 was installed and in choose that

194
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:23,990
folder so that the installation will

195
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,639
proceed the other thing we want to do is

196
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,710
make sure that STK default is selected

197
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,720
first going to give us full access

198
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,699
to the version of the JDK we've

199
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,430
installed 10 in this case so I'm gonna

200
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,860
click on account of that and we've now

201
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,380
configured IntelliJ IDEA for Java

202
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,180
there's just a few other things that we

203
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,409
need to configure before we end the

204
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,060
video, so come up here and click on

205
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,919
configure they want to click on settings

206
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,940
next thing we want to do is come down to

207
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,169
edit so click on this little arrow to

208
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,000
the left of editor come down here and

209
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,789
click a little arrow to left a general

210
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,759
then we wanna click on auto import

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,750
you want to make sure both these options

212
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,990
optimize import on the fly and also add

213
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,720
an ambiguous imports on the fly are both

214
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,940
checked they want to come down to

215
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,909
appearance we want to make sure that

216
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,370
show line numbers is checked now that's

217
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,900
generally the default these days for

218
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,770
IntelliJ IDEA

219
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,510
but it's a good thing to check too

220
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,010
that is checked which it is in this case

221
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,170
then we want to go to code forwarding

222
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,600
click on that and we want to deselect a

223
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,100
few things here we want to deselect one

224
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,630
line methods and also deselect closures

225
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,310
and then also generic constructor and

226
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,320
method parameters so what we're doing

227
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,020
here is we were stopping IntelliJ from

228
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,760
folding the code or hiding some of the

229
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,460
source code from us the code folding

230
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,470
heap feature can be very useful for

231
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,720
experienced developers who want to hide

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,820
portions of their code but in our case

233
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,890
because we're just starting out learning

234
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,840
Java for the first time we want to see

235
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,910
all our code so what we're doing is

236
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,590
we're turning off those options so that

237
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,210
we get to see instead of a further code

238
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,730
being folded and hidden we can see

239
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,020
everything we're gonna see all that Java

240
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,730
code so once we've done that you can

241
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,880
click on ok you're going to close down

242
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
IntelliJ IDEA and we're going to do is

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,460
top exit so closely in the terminal

244
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,770
window and now that we'll just hold a

245
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,690
desktop entry we should be able to come

246
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,400
over here and click type of the first

247
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,560
few letters of intelliJ

248
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,660
this case and check that or click that

249
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,490
rather and you can see that we've got

250
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,250
the ability to install or to run rather

251
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,050
IntelliJ IDEA from one click of the

252
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,820
mouse. Alright so that's our

253
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,860
installation complete, let's now move

254
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,420
on to the next video, we're going to

255
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,970
start taking a look at IntelliJ

256
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,420
specifically we're going to start

257
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,790
creating a Java program, so I'll see you

258
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,510
in the next video.
