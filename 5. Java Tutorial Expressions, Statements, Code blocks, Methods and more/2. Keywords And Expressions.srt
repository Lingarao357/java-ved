1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,140
In this video we're going to talk more
about keywords, and also just elaborate

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,810
a little bit on expressions, which we've
already covered to a degree previously.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,840
Firstly with the keywords.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,590
Now Java has actually got 50
reserved words that are used for

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,770
keywords in your applications.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,170
And you have seen some of
those in operation already.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,520
For example on the screen you can see some
of the keywords that are showing in blue.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,060
IntelliJ will actually
highlight keywords in blue to

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,990
show you that they actually are a keyword.

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,300
So, what I'm going to do is just go to a
browser, and I'm gonna paste in this link.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,690
And the link will be in
the resources section of this video.

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,130
And here is a list of Java keywords, and

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,280
you can see in the Java programming
language a keyword is

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,070
one of 53 reserved words that have a predefined

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,710
meaning in the language and as we scroll down in the list you will see some of this you already use boolean is one

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,210
double is another

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,360
And also float but don't worry you don't need to memorize

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,660
any of these because we are going to go

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,190
through each and every one of this in the course

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,160
but the thing

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,390
is they are reserved and lets swing back to IntelliJ and I'm going to talk further about that

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,860
And incidentally,

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,900
if you pull this video, I've created a new
project called KeywordsAndExpressions.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,990
So anything in blue,
that's showing IntelliJ editor is

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,400
confirming to you that
this is a reserved word.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,650
So for example, we can't go in here,
And create a variable called.

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,330
So if we type int int=5; unexpected token.

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,600
And that's because as far as IntelliJs
concerned, int is a reserved word.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,110
It's actually a data type.

30
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,540
We could use int2, that would be
quite valid because that's only using

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,190
part of the word, but
you can't use an exact word.

32
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,460
So anytime you get into weird errors,
just make sure that you're not

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,000
using a reserved keyword, and
you can refer back to that list.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,310
And some of the other keywords that you've
already seen that you can't use are false,

35
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,250
you saw false before, we've used that
in a previous video, true, and null.

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,500
But we'll be talking about those
as we progress through the course.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,190
So as I mentioned, by the time
you've finished with this course

38
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,860
you will have gone through
all 50 of those keywords.

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,890
We will have a good understanding
of what they actually are.

40
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,720
Okay, now lets talk now about expressions.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,740
We have talked a little bit
in the past about those and

42
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,490
you have seen some of those in operations,
but lets just expand that a little bit

43
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,650
more just so we have a specific
understanding of what expressions are.

44
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,150
I am just going to delete this and
make a bit more space.

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,400
Expressions are essentially building
blocks of all Java programs.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,350
You'll be using expressions a lot,
and expressions are built with values,

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,500
variables, and operators,
which you've seen previously.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,020
But also with method calls,

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,360
which we'll be discussing in a future
set of videos later in the course.

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,310
For example, if we wanted to
create an expression to convert

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,080
miles into kilometers, you'd need to
know firstly that a mile was equal to-

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,280
To 1.609344 kilometers.

53
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:19,030
So if we wanted to figure out what a 100
miles were converted to kilometers,

54
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,800
double kilometers equals
100 times 1.609344.

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,740
So that would be a valid statement.

56
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,210
For that line, the actual expression
is this component of the entire line.

57
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,070
The data type does not form
part of an expression, but

58
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,190
everything else on the line typically
forms or is part of the expression.

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,850
So the expression component is variables,
values, and operators.

60
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,050
All of those used in this case.

61
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,390
We've got a variable kilometers.

62
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,890
We've got values, like a 101.609344.

63
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,390
And of course, operators,
equals, and multiplications.

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,970
So that's an expression
this component of the line.

65
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,630
By adding the datatype,
we're creating a valid java statement.

66
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,900
The combination of that And also the semi
colon at the end of the line as well.

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,250
Some more examples of expressions.

68
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,340
We've got something like
if highscore equals 50.

69
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,030
As we've done before.

70
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,750
We're getting an error because
I haven't defined the variable.

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,900
So I'll just define that.

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,810
So, this component is the expression.

73
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,420
Within the brackets as you can see there.

74
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,980
So, the keyword for
if in the brackets, and

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,320
the braces as well do not form part of
the expression as this component in here.

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,990
And incidentally there's
another expression,

77
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,570
and the expression is quite valid as well.

78
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,080
With a literal value as it's
got there with the number 50.

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,290
And finally, another valid expression.

80
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,690
Is this component here.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,750
So the component within
the brackets is also an expression.

82
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,950
And that's actually calling a method.

83
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,220
And we'll be talking about methods in
a future section of the course as well.

84
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,600
The main idea is just to get your head
around what components of the entire line

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,500
is an expression from what
an expression actually is.

86
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,630
Just a confirmation when
you're defining a variable

87
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,620
the entire line minus
the semi colon at the end and

88
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,730
the datatype is the expression,
so that's that component there.

89
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,310
Or with the literal value

90
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,960
that's the component there minus the data
top at the start and also the semi colon.

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,070
If you've got a control statement, control
flow statement, and we'll be talking more

92
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,330
about those also in future videos, the
component in brackets is the expression.

93
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,460
And if you're using a method, and again,
methods, we're going to be covering later,

94
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,910
but anything in the brackets, essentially,
that is also an expression as well.

95
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,930
And now that you know that
I'm going to clear this off,

96
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,330
the other that's off the screen.

97
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,380
And my challenge for you is as follows.

98
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,400
Have a look at the code that
you can see on the screen.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,790
Write down what components of the lines
I've entered there are expressions.

100
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,060
And come back and check your results
after you've had a go at it.

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,230
So, how did you get on?

102
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,500
Did you figure it out?

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,450
Let's go through and talk this through.

104
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,190
So the components that are expressions,
firstly on the first line.

105
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,560
The score equals a hundred
component is the expression.

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
Remembering that a data type and

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,490
also the semicolon to the end the line
are not part of the expression.

108
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,610
In the second example,
the if score greater than 99.

109
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,760
Well the part in brackets
is also an expression.

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,710
So the if, the braces, and the brackets
do not form part of an expression.

111
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,480
In the next case we’ll be
printing out to the console.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,800
The component that’s in between
the brackets in the double quotes

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,820
is the expression.

114
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,990
The final example here, score = 0 that
is also a valid expression as well.

115
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,300
So that you figure all this out,
congratulations if you got them all.

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,550
So that's expressions and
you'll be seeing expressions and

117
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,270
keywords in use a lot
more in future videos.

118
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,750
But speaking of future videos,
in the next video we're gonna be

119
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,120
discussing statements which
we talks on briefly here.

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,460
Also, what's spaces and the use of
indenting, So, I'll see you on that video.
