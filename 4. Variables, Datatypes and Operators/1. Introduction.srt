00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,090
Welcome to Section 4. Tim Buchalka here again.

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,010
And in this section, we're going to further the

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,010
concepts we learnt in the previous section,

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,510
and we're going to start talking about variables,

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,510
data types, and operators.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,660
Three very important features that you'll need

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,140
to understand in order to create Java applications.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,620
So, let's make a start on that right now.
